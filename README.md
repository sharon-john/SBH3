# SBH3

This was a hackathon project developed by myself and my teammates: Dinkar Khattar, Ronald Gao, Divij Ohri and Samar Seth at SB Hacks III. 

Overview: We developed an Android application called Insight that utilised image search parsing APIs and integrated it with the Android system 
so that a user would be able to take a picture of anything on their phone and the app would tell the user what the object in the picture is.
In order to make this app more immediately functional to users, we developed some functionality around this core technology. Dinkar and I worked on 
creating a set of custom links incorporated into the app which would show the user what the best prices for the object were on Amazon and Target store.
